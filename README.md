This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in VHDL: an unintentional latch created within a process.  The provided `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vhdl` offers the corrected version.  The issue arises from the process's sensitivity list not explicitly including `data_in`, leading to unpredictable behavior when `data_in` changes asynchronously with the clock.
